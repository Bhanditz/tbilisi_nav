# Tbilisi nav

Main idea of writing this app was practicing in new tools, acrchitecture, UI tricks or libs, anything 
I wanted to try in "real" project that solves a problem. 

It uses [Kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin) and MVI acrhitecture from [Google's repo](https://github.com/oldergod/android-architecture). 

For DI I used [Koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin), a nice lightweight lib.

Backend for building a route used form [TTC](http://ttc.com.ge) api. Some of the code you'll find was havily inspited by sweet [Tbilisi bus App](https://github.com/shvelo/tbilisi-bus)

App icon is from awesome [Norbi Gaal](https://www.behance.net/gallery/23054143/Budapest-Public-Transport-flat-icon-set)'s work.

This is still a WP project with a lot of cool stuff in mind.
